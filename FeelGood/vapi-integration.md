# Here’s a step-by-step guide to make this work

Step 1: Understand Vapi and Its Capabilities
Vapi is a platform designed to help developers build, test, and deploy voice AI agents. It provides a Web SDK and APIs to integrate real-time voice functionality into applications. For your use case:
Vapi will act as the voice interface, allowing users to speak to the assistant and receive spoken responses.
You’ll feed it user-specific mood data (from Firebase) as context, so it can analyze patterns and provide tailored advice.
Key Vapi components you’ll use:
Web SDK: For integrating voice functionality into your SwiftUI app (via a web view or custom integration).
Server-side API: To configure the assistant with user data and instructions.
Step 2: Adjust Your Tech Stack Assumptions
Your PRD mentions Supabase, but you’re using Firebase as your BaaS. Here’s how your tech stack aligns:
Frontend: SwiftUI (iOS app).
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore for database, Storage for voice/text notes).
AI Voice Assistant: Vapi (replacing or complementing OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for voice interaction).
Data Flow: Firebase → SwiftUI → Vapi.
Since Vapi is primarily a voice AI platform, it doesn’t natively query databases like Firebase. You’ll need to fetch the data in your app and pass it to Vapi as context.
Step 3: Fetch User Data from Firebase
In your SwiftUI app, you’ll query Firebase Firestore to retrieve the user’s mood logs. Here’s an example structure and code:
Firestore Data Structure
Assume your Firestore database has a collection like this:
users/
  {userId}/
    mood_logs/
      {logId}: {
        timestamp: "2025-03-21T08:00:00Z",
        happiness_score: 7,
        text_note: "Feeling good after a workout",
        voice_note_url: "<https://firebase.storage/url-to-voice-note>"
      }
Swift Code to Fetch Data
Using the Firebase SDK for Swift, fetch the user’s mood logs:
swift
import FirebaseFirestore
import FirebaseAuth

struct MoodLog: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: String
    let timestamp: Date
    let happinessScore: Int
    let textNote: String?
    let voiceNoteURL: String?
}

func fetchMoodLogs(forUserId userId: String) async throws -> [MoodLog] {
    let db = Firestore.firestore()
    let snapshot = try await db.collection("users")
        .document(userId)
        .collection("mood_logs")
        .order(by: "timestamp", descending: true)
        .getDocuments()

    return snapshot.documents.compactMap { doc in
        let data = doc.data()
        guard let timestamp = (data["timestamp"] as? Timestamp)?.dateValue(),
              let happinessScore = data["happiness_score"] as? Int else { return nil }
        return MoodLog(
            id: doc.documentID,
            timestamp: timestamp,
            happinessScore: happinessScore,
            textNote: data["text_note"] as? String,
            voiceNoteURL: data["voice_note_url"] as? String
        )
    }
}
Call this in your SwiftUI view model:
swift
@MainActor
class MoodViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var moodLogs: [MoodLog] = []

    func loadMoodLogs() async {
        guard let userId = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else { return }
        do {
            moodLogs = try await fetchMoodLogs(forUserId: userId)
        } catch {
            print("Error fetching mood logs: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
Step 4: Prepare Data as Context for Vapi
Vapi’s assistant can use a context string or document to understand the user’s data. Convert your mood logs into a concise text format:
swift
func generateVapiContext(from logs: [MoodLog]) -> String {
    var context = "User's mood logs:\n"
    for log in logs {
        let dateString = ISO8601DateFormatter().string(from: log.timestamp)
        context += "- \(dateString): Happiness \(log.happinessScore)/10. Note: \(log.textNote ?? "None")\n"
    }
    context += "\nInstructions: Analyze patterns in the user's happiness scores and notes. Suggest ways to improve their mood based on trends (e.g., low scores after late nights, high scores after exercise)."
    return context
}
Example output:
User's mood logs:

- 2025-03-21T08:00:00Z: Happiness 7/10. Note: Feeling good after a workout
- 2025-03-20T20:00:00Z: Happiness 4/10. Note: Stressed from work
- 2025-03-20T08:00:00Z: Happiness 6/10. Note: None

Instructions: Analyze patterns in the user's happiness scores and notes. Suggest ways to improve their mood based on trends (e.g., low scores after late nights, high scores after exercise).
Step 5: Integrate Vapi into Your SwiftUI App
Vapi provides a Web SDK, which you can integrate into your iOS app via a WKWebView or by calling its API directly. Since you’re using SwiftUI, here’s how to proceed:
Option 1: Use Vapi Web SDK via WKWebView
Set Up Vapi Dashboard:
Go to <https://dashboard.vapi.ai> (e.g., your provided link) and create an assistant.
Configure the assistant with a generic prompt and enable it to accept dynamic context.
Get your assistant’s public key or ID.
Embed Vapi in SwiftUI:
Create a web view to load Vapi’s voice interface:
swift
import SwiftUI
import WebKit

struct VapiWebView: UIViewRepresentable {
    let context: String
    let assistantId: String = "YOUR_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID"

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> WKWebView {
        let webView = WKWebView()
        let html = """
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
            <script src="https://unpkg.com/@vapi-ai/web-sdk@latest/dist/vapi.js"></script>
            <script>
                const vapi = new Vapi('\(assistantId)');
                vapi.start({
                    context: `\(context.replacingOccurrences(of: "`", with: "\\`"))`
                });
            </script>
        </body>
        </html>
        """
        webView.loadHTMLString(html, baseURL: nil)
        return webView
    }

    func updateUIView(_ uiView: WKWebView, context: Context) {}
}

struct VoiceAssistantView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = MoodViewModel()
    @State private var context: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        VapiWebView(context: context)
            .frame(height: 300)
            .task {
                await viewModel.loadMoodLogs()
                context = generateVapiContext(from: viewModel.moodLogs)
            }
    }
}
Permissions:
Add microphone permissions to Info.plist:
xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your microphone for voice interaction.</string>
Option 2: Use Vapi API Directly
If Vapi supports a REST API for initiating calls (check <https://docs.vapi.ai>), you can:
Fetch the mood logs in Swift.
Send the context to Vapi’s server-side API via HTTP:
swift
func startVapiSession(context: String) async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "<https://api.vapi.ai/start-session>")! // Hypothetical endpoint
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("Bearer YOUR_VAPI_API_KEY", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")

    let body: [String: Any] = [
        "assistantId": "YOUR_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID",
        "context": context
    ]
    request.httpBody = try JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: body)
    
    let (_, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
    guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpResponse.statusCode == 200 else {
        throw URLError(.badServerResponse)
    }
    // Handle response (e.g., WebSocket URL for voice interaction)
}
Use a WebSocket or audio library in Swift to handle the voice stream.
Step 6: Configure Vapi Assistant
On the Vapi dashboard:
Set up the assistant to:
Accept dynamic context (your mood log data).
Respond with natural, conversational advice (e.g., “I notice your happiness dips after stressful workdays—maybe try a quick evening walk?”).
Test it with sample context to ensure it identifies patterns and suggests improvements.
Step 7: Test and Refine
Test Flow: Open app → Fetch mood logs → Start Vapi session → Speak (“Why am I feeling down?”) → Get response.
Refine: Adjust context formatting or Vapi prompts if the assistant’s responses aren’t specific enough.
Feasibility Check
Your approach (querying Firebase directly and passing data to Vapi) is possible and avoids Cloud Functions, reducing latency and complexity. However:
Vapi Context Limits: Check Vapi’s documentation for max context size (e.g., 4096 characters). Summarize logs if needed.
Real-Time Updates: If logs update during a session, you’ll need to restart the Vapi session with new context.
Voice Notes: Firebase Storage URLs can’t be directly analyzed by Vapi unless transcribed first (consider adding a transcription step using Firebase ML or a third-party API).
Next Steps
Sign up at <https://dashboard.vapi.ai> and explore the assistant setup.
Confirm Vapi’s exact API/SDK capabilities via <https://docs.vapi.ai>.
Implement and test the WebView or API approach in a prototype.
